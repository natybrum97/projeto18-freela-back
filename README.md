For the `shopping` entity, only one route was created:

- POST `/compra`: Registers the user's purchase.

For the `products` entity, ten routes were created:

- GET `/catalogo`: Returns all available products;

- POST `/check`: Saves the states of each check box;
- GET `/check`: Returns the states of each check box;
